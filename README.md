# Ponyfm-cli

This is a quick and dirty cli client for [pony.fm](https://pony.fm). It is hardcoded to play songs with mplayer, and uses a local dump of pony.fm's database for queries.

### But why?

I strongly dislike GUIs. They are generally slower to use and assume mouse-based interaction. Also, Chrome is pissing memory all over the floor, and uses half a core to render the trackbar - yuck!
